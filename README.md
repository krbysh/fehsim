# FEHSIM - Fire Emblem Heroes Simulator

The project is a proof of concept that got out of control. Valter was partially responsible. 
You can look the live version at it's [Github pages site](https://bardackx.github.io/fehsim/)

## TODO

This is a list of things yet to implement

### Combat

Even when the fundations for the combat system are there it has not been implemented yet

### Walls

I didn't plan enough on the architechture of the map class (is basically empty) so this is not implemented, writing the CSS for the walls and making sure they look good is boring as weel.

### Status Panel

The small panel where the combat results appear, that's not implemented

### Unit building screen

There's no way to make your team without altering the script.js file, so this is something that has to be done.

### Match building screen

I could skip this by just reading a json file, but even that need a selection screen —Oh fuck

### Selection screen

Well, this

## Whishlist

I wish somebody could write everything related to unit/team building, that would be nice
